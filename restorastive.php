    				<li>Non-surgical and surgical gum treatment</li>
    			</ul>
    			<h2 class="my-5 text-left">Crowns and Bridges</h2>
    			<p>Crowns and bridges are useful in restoring and enhancing teeth that are damaged or to take the place of missing teeth.</p>
    			<h3 class="my-5 text-left">Crowns</h3>
    			<p>Dental crowns are caps that are used to cover a natural tooth, to improve both its form and function. Dental crowns very closely resemble the appearance of your natural tooth, and serves as a cover for the parts that need to be improved or treated. Once a dental crown is firmly in place, it covers the entire tooth from the gum line – and essentially becomes the new outer part of the affected tooth.</p>
    			<p>Crowns may be used to:</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Replace a large filling when there is little tooth structure remaining</li>
    				<li>Protect a weak tooth from fracturing</li>
    				<li>Restore a fractured tooth</li>
    				<li>Attach a bridge</li>
    				<li>Cover a dental implant</li>
    				<li>Cover a discolored or poorly shaped tooth</li>
    				<li>Cover a tooth that has had root canal treatment</li>
    			</ul>
    			<h3 class="my-5 text-left">Bridges</h3>
    			<p>Dental bridges are used to close the gap left by several missing teeth, and are considered as fixed partial dentures. A dental bridge is attached to the natural teeth on either side of the space left by tooth loss; the bridge is made up of a series of false teeth which will “bridge” the gap left by missing teeth. With the help of dental bridges, you can once again flash bright smiles – even after you have suffered from tooth loss.</p>

    			<p>It is essential to replace the missing tooth as soon as possible. If not Cured, the teeth surrounding the gap begin to shift inward. Since teeth use their adjoining teeth for support, if one is missing they begin to “fall” and shift into the open spaces. This may degrade the situation because of the changes in force  and can ultimately result in problems with the jaw.<p>
    			<p>Bridges and crowns are long lasting and can last a lifespan with proper oral hygiene.</p>
    			<h2 class="my-5 text-left">Bonding and Fillings</h2>
    			<h3 class="my-5 text-left">Bonding</h3>
    			<p>Bonding involves adhering composite resin material that is matched to the color of the tooth, to the front of the tooth. This is performed to repair damage caused by decay, to alter the alignment of the tooth, close gaps between the teeth, or for other cosmetic purposes.</p>
    			<p>First the surface of the tooth is roughened in order to accept the bonding. A gel is applied so the resin will adhere to the surface of the tooth. The composite is then placed on the tooth and the bonding agent hardens with intense light. The last step is shaping and polishing to give a lustrous finish.</p>
    			<h3 class="my-5 text-left">Filling</h3>
    			<p>Fillings is helpful in repairing damaged, broken down and decayed teeth thus ensuring that they are long lasting. It is all about filling in those gaps that can arise in your teeth.</p>
    			<p>There are many different material used for filling including gold, silver, plastic and porcelain. The dentist will discuss with you and decide which material is best, depending on the extent of repair, which type of filling is needed, and what cost.</p>
    			<h2 class="my-5 text-left">Root Canal Treatment</h2>
    			<p>Root canal treatment is a process that are done to save a tooth that has been badly damaged (due to tooth decay or other dental problems), or when the tooth’s pulp has become infected. A root canal treatment is needed to prevent abscess from forming, and is done to avoid having the infection spread to other parts of the tooth – or to other teeth and oral tissues.</p>
    			<p>An infected tooth pulp will be removed during a root canal treatment, and the root canal will be filled and sealed to prevent the spread of further infection. The removal of the infected parts of the tooth makes it possible for the damaged tooth to be saved from being extracted, so you can still enjoy the function of that particular tooth.</p>
