    			<p>Gum treatments are done to address certain diseases or conditions that affect the good health of the gums; if left undiagnosed or untreated for a long period of time, gum disease can lead to more serious complications â€“ and can even result to tooth loss. It is best to deal with gum disease in the earliest stages, so that the gum treatments can be done in most effective ways and possible in preventing more serious dental problems from developing on your overall dental health.</p>
    			<p>An infected tooth pulp will be removed during a root canal treatment, and the root canal will be filled and sealed to prevent the spread of further infection. The removal of the infected parts of the tooth makes it possible for the damaged tooth to be saved from being extracted, so you can still enjoy the function of that particular tooth.</p>
    			<p>The type of gum treatment that can be done will depend upon the nature of the gum problem that needs to be addressed. Minor gum problems may be addressed with non-surgical gum treatments, such as root planing or scaling, which work on cleaning root surfaces. Surgical gum treatments may be needed for treating more advanced gum diseases such as periodontitis; some of the surgical gum treatment options include crown lengthening, gum grafting, and pocket reduction. Cosmetic gum treatments, on the other hand, focus on improving the beautification aspect of your smile.</p>
