    			<p>Taking proper care of your dental health involves good oral care habits, as well as going to the dentist for regular check-ups to ensure that dental problems may be prevented or treated in the best possible manner.However, there are times when even the best dental health care may not be enough to ensure that your teeth are protected. Trauma to the teeth and the facial areas can come from accidents, injuries, or even from unconscious teeth grinding. If you feel that you need additional protection from your teeth from these events or circumstances, a mouth guard may be your best option.</p>
    			<p>Custom designed mouthguards and night guards are made of flexible plastic and molded to fit the shape of your teeth. Mouthguards are recommended to protect the jaw and teeth during physical activity and sports such as boxing, football, basketball, or other activities where your mouth may be hit. Guards also protect the soft tissues of your tongue, lips and cheek lining. Nightguards are recommended for patients who clench or grind their teeth at night as a way to protect their teeth and bite.</p>
