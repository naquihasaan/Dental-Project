    			<p>If your tooth has been damaged by decay or trauma, our dentists will try to restore it with a filling, crown and other treatment options. However, when the damage is too severe to be restored and a root canal treatment is not possible to save your tooth, your dentist may recommend a tooth extraction. After careful examination and treatment, the dentist may advise to have a tooth extracted. Before a tooth is removed, the dentist will take an x-ray in order to understand the shape and position of the tooth and surrounding bone</p>
    			<p>A local anaesthetic will usually be needed prior to a tooth extraction procedure, to ensure that the patient will not feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. Simple tooth extractions will require the dentist to use an elevator to loosen the tooth, before it can be pulled out with the use of forceps. Surgical tooth extractions, on the other hand, may require the cutting of the gums to get to an impacted tooth, which is a tooth that has not erupted fully from the gum line. After extracting the affected tooth, the gums will need to be stitched closed once more.</p>
